Currently I am developing on this branch. The work is aimed at enstablishig a VPN channel between my personal computer and a remote server: ubuntu@ec2-34-253-203-81.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com .

The next step will be to integrate ROS within this tunnel, in order to allow remote communication between ROS-based machines.
